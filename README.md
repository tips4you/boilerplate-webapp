# Boilerplate Webapp

This is a simple boilerplate web application. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the application locally.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the `boilerplate-webapp` directory:
    ```
    cd boilerplate-webapp
    ```

3. Install the required npm packages:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Application

### Backend

To start the backend server, run the following command in the `boilerplate-webapp` directory:

npm start


### Frontend

To start the frontend, navigate to the `client` directory and run the following command:

cd client npm start


Your application should now be running locally!

## Note on Environment Variables

The application's credentials are stored in an `.env` file. For security reasons, it's best practice not to include this file in your Git repository. However, as this application uses a dummy database, the `.env` file has been included in the repository for convenience.
